Hi! I'm a PhD Student in the Waterloo Intelligent Systems Lab (WISELab) at the University of Waterloo. I am broadly interested in creating embodied autonomous agents and systems. My PhD work focuses
chiefly on motion prediction and planning tasks for self-driving vehicles, and especially how to tackle the problems of covariate shift and casual confusion that hamper closed-loop performance of popular methods.
