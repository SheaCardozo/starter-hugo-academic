Hi! I'm a Machine Learning Scientist at Tenyks, currently developing Explainable AI (XAI) methods for Computer Vision. I am broadly interested in representation learning in both computer vision and natural language processing. Subtopics of interest include self-supervised and unsupervised learning, generalization in deep learning, multimodal generative modelling, and explainable and interpretable AI.
